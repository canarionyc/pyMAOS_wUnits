* Project context: analisys of building and civil engineering structures. I would like to be able to handle structures like those created by architect Santiago Calatrava.
* Preferred libraries: a) Use scipy instead of numpy where possible to avoid the numpy's broadcasting of dimension b) Don't use the Path module
* Performance considerations: It should be optimized for dealing with structures with thousands of members
* Use only ASCII characters, no UTF-8 nor UTF-16 in input or output
* It is OK to have debug print statements
